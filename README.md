# Building-Visual-Studio-Code-Mastering-Redux

The VS Code-Inspired Application is a project that mimics the Visual Studio Code interface, offering features like tabs and a file explorer.


It leverages Redux Toolkit to efficiently manage the state of open and closed files or folders. Recursive components are used to handle complex, nested folder structures dynamically, mirroring VS Code's hierarchical design. 


This project demonstrates expertise in UI/UX design, state management, and recursion while providing a highly interactive and organized interface for users.
